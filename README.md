# Composite Market Sentiment

A Python script that computes a composite market sentiment indicator using data from Nasdaq-100 companies. It aggregates various indicators—including momentum, new highs/lows, market breadth, put/call ratios, junk bond spreads, VIX, and safe haven measures—using data from Yahoo Finance and FRED. The final composite score is displayed as a gauge plot.
